## Anscombe's Quartet

## Visualizing Data

## Iteration. Fast iteration cycle

  - Traditional statistics (and small data sets)
  - Visualizing data (as well as large data sets and powerful computers)

Modern data analysis. [Data Analysis With Open Source Tools][janert]

## A Modern Quartet?
An equivalent to Anscombe's quartet in higher dimensions. Visualization only gets you so far, and thus a battery of statistical tests is still quite necessary.

  - Sparse data in high dimensions; the curse of dimensionality
  - PCA and good fit in too few dimensions
